<h3> Abstract </h3>
​
The easy access and exponential growth of the information available on social media networks has made it intricate to distinguish between false and true information. The easy dissemination of information by way of sharing has added to exponential growth of its falsification. The credibility of social media networks is also at stake where the spreading of fake information is prevalent. Thus, it has become a research challenge to automatically check the information viz a viz its source, content and publisher for categorizing it as false or true. Machine learning has played a vital role in classification of the information although with some limitations. This paper reviews various Machine learning approaches in detection of fake and fabricated news. The limitation of such and approaches and improvisation by way of implementing deep learning is also reviewed.
​
To avoid spreading of fake news, a machine learning algorithm is put to work. It categorizes the news of interest as “true” or “false”, it does so by simply tracing back the information to its source. This model is aimed at restoring credibility of social media networks as it is one of the major sources of information today. The source of information plays a major role in how much to trust it and hence, this model traces the source in order to verify the same for the common man. The more data you feed in, the more will be the accuracy of this model. It analyses the pattern of the news and figures out whether or not the source is genuine. A pipeline process is created to remove stop-words. Processes like tokenization and padding are performed. Tokenization is the process of dividing text into a set of meaningful pieces. These pieces are called tokens. Padding is a term relevant to convolutional neural networks as it refers to the number of pixels added to an image when it is being processed by the kernel of a CNN.
